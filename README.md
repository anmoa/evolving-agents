EAT is a Python toolkit for constructing advanced, multi-agent applications where autonomy, adaptability, and robust orchestration are crucial. It enables the implementation of **AI-First strategies**, where agent-driven workflows are designed to handle tasks that complex human workflows are currently capable of doing. Move beyond simple agent chains to create ecosystems that can dynamically respond to requirements, learn from interactions, and improve over time‚Äîall within defined governance boundaries.

## Why Evolving Agents Toolkit for AI-First?

Building true **AI-First systems**‚Äîwhere agent workflows are capable of handling tasks currently performed in complex human processes‚Äîrequires more than just individual agents. EAT focuses on orchestrating the entire **agent ecosystem**:

*   **üéØ Goal-Oriented Orchestration:** Interact via high-level goals given to a central `SystemAgent` (e.g., "Process this invoice," "Generate a project backlog from this meeting transcript"). The `SystemAgent` handles the complex "how," mimicking a project manager coordinating resources. It plans, finds or creates components, executes tasks, and manages internal workflows derived from the goal. You state the objective; the system orchestrates the execution.
*   **üß† Intelligent Component Management & Discovery:** A `SmartLibrary` acts as a central repository for reusable agents and tools, enabling semantic search (find tools based on *what they do*, not just names) and versioning. Crucially, it supports **task-aware retrieval** using a dual embedding strategy, ensuring discovered components are relevant to the specific task at hand.
*   **üöå Dynamic Communication & Service Bus:** The `SmartAgentBus` (with distinct System and Data buses) allows agents to discover and request capabilities across the system dynamically, decoupling components and enabling flexible interactions similar to microservices.
*   **üå± Adaptive Evolution:** Components aren't static. EAT provides mechanisms (`EvolveComponentTool`) for the `SystemAgent` to evolve agents and tools based on new requirements, performance feedback, or changing contexts, enabling the system to adapt and improve over time.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Governed Execution & Human-in-the-Loop:** Implement optional, multi-level review checkpoints (design, component selection, execution plan) using the `IntentReviewAgent` and specialized tools. This allows for human oversight or AI-driven safety checks before critical steps are executed, ensuring alignment and safety within defined boundaries (`Firmware`).
*   **üß© Modular & Interoperable:** Seamlessly integrate agents and tools built with different frameworks (e.g., BeeAI, OpenAI Assistants SDK) via a flexible provider system (`AgentFactory`, `ToolFactory`, `providers/`). Define clear operational rules and safety guardrails using `Firmware`.
*   **üí° Task-Specific Context:** The architecture incorporates a `SmartContext` and a **Dual Embedding Strategy** within the `SmartLibrary` to provide agents with context specifically relevant to their current task, reducing noise and improving performance compared to standard semantic retrieval.
*   **ü§ñ Self-Management & Improvement:** The architecture allows system agents like `SystemAgent` and (optionally) `ArchitectZero` to collaboratively design, implement, manage, and even improve the ecosystem, including the toolkit's own components (see `examples/self_improvement/evolve_smart_library.py`).

**In short: If you aim to build AI-First systems that are more than the sum of their parts‚Äîsystems that can coordinate diverse capabilities, adapt to new challenges, provide highly relevant context, manage complexity autonomously, and operate under governance with optional human oversight‚ÄîEAT provides the essential structure and tools.**

## Key Features

*   **`SystemAgent` Orchestrator:** A central ReAct agent (using BeeAI) acting as the primary entry point. It uses specialized tools to manage the entire component lifecycle (search, create, evolve) and task execution based on high-level goals. It leverages `SmartContext` for task-aware operations and can operate within an optional human-in-the-loop review process.
*   **`SmartLibrary` with Dual Embedding:** Persistent storage (`smart_library.json`) with versioning and evolution capabilities. Features advanced semantic search using a **Dual Embedding Strategy**:
    *   **Content Embedding (`E_orig`):** Represents the component's raw content/code (`T_orig`).
    *   **Applicability Embedding (`E_raz`):** Represents an LLM-generated text (`T_raz`) describing the component's potential tasks, context, and implications.
    *   **Task-Aware Search:** Enables finding components based not just on what they *are* but *what they are relevant for* in a specific task context.
*   **`SmartAgentBus` (Dual Bus):** Manages agent registration, discovery, health monitoring (System Bus), and capability-based requests/communication (Data Bus), logging interactions (`agent_bus_logs_demo.json`).
*   **`SmartContext`:** Facilitates passing relevant data and task context between agents and tools, enabling the task-aware retrieval mechanism.
*   **Internal Workflow Engine:** For complex goals, the `SystemAgent` can *internally* generate and execute multi-step YAML workflows (`GenerateWorkflowTool`, `ProcessWorkflowTool`), abstracting this complexity from the user.
*   **Intent Review System (Human-in-the-Loop):** (Optional, configurable via `.env`) Enables multi-level review and approval of system actions:
    *   **`IntentReviewAgent`:** An AI agent specialized in reviewing plans and designs.
    *   **Review Tools:** `WorkflowDesignReviewTool`, `ComponentSelectionReviewTool`, `ApprovePlanTool` facilitate human or AI review at different stages.
    *   **`IntentPlan`:** A structured representation of the steps the `SystemAgent` intends to execute, generated by `ProcessWorkflowTool` when review is enabled. Ensures safety and alignment before execution.
*   **Component Evolution:** Adapt agents/tools using different strategies (e.g., standard, conservative, aggressive, domain adaptation) orchestrated by the `SystemAgent` via `EvolveComponentTool`.
*   **Multi-Framework Support:** Pluggable provider architecture (`providers/`, `AgentFactory`, `ToolFactory`) allows integrating components built with different SDKs (e.g., `BeeAIProvider`, `OpenAIAgentsProvider`). Adapters (`adapters/`) bridge interfaces (e.g., `OpenAIToolAdapter`).
*   **Governance & Safety:** Define operational rules and safety constraints via `Firmware` and apply them during component creation/evolution or runtime (e.g., `OpenAIGuardrailsAdapter`). Enhanced by the optional Intent Review system.
*   **(Optional) `ArchitectZero`:** A specialized agent (see `agents/architect_zero.py`) that can be called *internally* by the `SystemAgent` (via the Agent Bus) to design complex multi-component solutions based on requirements.
